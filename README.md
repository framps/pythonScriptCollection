# pythonScriptCollection
A collection of Python scripts I wrote which may or may not be useful for others :-)

1. loginAndGetDataFromFritz.py - Python prototype to login into AVM fritzbox and retrieve some data. [See here](https://github.com/framps/bashScriptCollection) for a bash version and [here](https://github.com/framps/golang_tutorial/tree/master/loginFritz) for a go version.
